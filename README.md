# Authoduino
Inspired & somewhat based on Doorduino, but stateful in granted or denied access.
Used for authorising access to an EV chargepoint located at Revspace. Cars are called "auto" (automobiel) in Dutch, hence the name.

Arduino code serves as interface for the managing code. The managing code (will probably be run on a Raspberry Pi) yet to be written.
